Yesterday, I made an attempt to use PasswordHash and tried to directly convert it into a CI Library. Failing at that, I went ahead and downloaded **SimpleLoginSecure**.

Refer to my [question][1] on Stack Overflow, regarding why I have been talking about Password Hashing so much.

The library is pretty cool. Here is the [link][2] to it.

#### What I did?

1.  Put the downloaded file in application/libraries
2.  Made minor table name and field name changes
3.  DONE

It’s super easy and it comes with 4 functions.

1.  Create
2.  Login
3.  Logout
4.  Delete

This is all you need in a basic login and it’s all there. Just minor customizations required and \*poof\*, work done.

And the best part about this library is that it uses **bcrypt** to hash passwords. And that is why it is a beauty. It uses [PHPass][3].

That is all, and I still haven’t got any reply to my [question][4] regarding Form Validation. Really need help with it.
