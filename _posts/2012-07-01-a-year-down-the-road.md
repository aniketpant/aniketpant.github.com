## The story so far

It has been just a little over a year that I bought [aniketpant.com](http://aniketpant.com) and nearly the same time that I first set foot on the mysterious webbed grounds of the internet.

I starting creating web pages in February 2011. Before that I only knew **C++** and had seen my father coding in PHP.
The first thing I worked on was **Joomla!** and slowly I took on **HTML**, **CSS** and a bit of **jQuery**. And in sometime I was working with **PHP**.

Soon, came the interesting phase of my new interest. **WordPress** – it's like the anti-hero of my superhero tale that I befriended and my made my most precious ally.

And after a couple of months, I got to know about **Codeigniter**. And for the most of the following year, I was building small applications. It has been an amazing experience with the great framework until recently I found **Laravel**. I also wrote a [little piece on my shift](/2012/05/a-shift-from-codeigniter-to-laravel) too.

## How I got my powers?

I started with reading articles on [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) and [Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmagazine.com). I still go through them regularly.

And soon, I found the superheroes of the web. I was following each and every word by [Trent Walton](http://twitter.com/TrentWalton), [Harry Roberts](http://twitter.com/csswizardry), [Simurai](http://twitter.com/simurai), [Divya Manian](http://twitter.com/divya) and [many others](http://https://twitter.com/noremap/get-webbed).

The best way to develop yourself is to put down a weblog. Write whatever you learn, how you did it and even the parts where you felt a hitch. Because, there will be thousands of newcomers who are starting today and they can learn from your experience for sure.

## Grab your costume!

I have learnt hell loads of things. Understood the new trends and what is happening and the best part is that even though you can keep reading all of it, unless you actually work on it, **you'll just be wasting your time**.

So, if you wish to make a difference, if you wish to shape the future of the web and become *the architects of tomorrow*. **Start now!**
