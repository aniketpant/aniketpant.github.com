I feel good today. Really really good. There are just so many things on my mind that I want to write about and work on ideas that I keep noting down in my little spark file. Yes, I have been maintaining a spark file, though I write it in a diary like format.

[Mark My Word][1] has been doing really well. The [amazing speaker line-up][2] is nearly complete and we are working hard on getting the required finances for making it a success.

The things on my list at the moment are -

1.  **Making Mark My Word a success and continuing with the fun work**
2.  Redesigning my website
3.  Renaming my website to **Rawrrr** (Many reasons for it to be called that)
4.  A new cleaner design in all my existing work
5.  Learning OOCSS
6.  Working with inuit.css and building a custom front-end starter project
7.  Discuss with myself whether to shift from WP to Jekyll or not

It’s not that I don’t like my current design but I am just going to throw away the sidebar from my next design. I am so so bored with having so much of excessive content on my page where anyone would lose focus if you don’t use colors and typefaces properly.
