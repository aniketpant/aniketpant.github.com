My old problem was not solved by now, and I was going through a question on Stack Overflow.

I got to know that MD5 should not be used in anyway. Then I read about SHA1 vs bcrypt. After quite some discussion and thanks to [Lawrence][1], I got a brilliant solution and really good lesson on password hashing.

Now, I would be using bcrypt to hash my passwords.

See this post for the [solution][2].

To implement this password hashing technique, there is a library available.

1.  Download the files from [here][3].
2.  Then, extract the files to application/library.

#### Load the library

    $this->load->library('PasswordHash',array(8, FALSE));
    

#### How to hash the password?

    $this->PasswordHash->HashPassword($password);
    

#### Check if a password is correct?

    $password = $_POST['password'];
    $actualPassword = /*Get the hashed password from your db*/;
    
    $check = $this->PasswordHash->CheckPassword($password, $actualPassword);
