Under a starry sky<br/>
The moon passes by<br/>
There i lie watching the sky<br/>
Thinking about the days that went by<br/>
Don't know if they were a dream<br/>
But still can't tell if they were real<br/>
I am still sure of meeting you again<br/>
Because even if we go on different roads<br/>
I know I will meet you again<br/>
Because there are no two roads that don't meet again<br/>
And then coming to a full circle<br/>
I will say that I missed you<br/>
We will lead a new life together<br/>
And kiss you and say I will never leave you again
