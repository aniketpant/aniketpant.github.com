In the morning, I was reading the newspaper and I saw this article that Arindam Chaudhuri is suing Google. Read [this][1].

I know he can get weird and very very stupid everyday, but this is the limit. Suing a search engine. The most common misconception is that “People think Google is the source of information”. Well this is just wrong. Google just indexes all the content in the world for us.

Even what I am writing here will show up on Google if you search for it. And Mr. Arindam Chaudhuri, what you see as the second second suggestion on searching your name on Google, this is what you are related the most to by people.

I suggest you do your job and let the search engines get information for people to see.
