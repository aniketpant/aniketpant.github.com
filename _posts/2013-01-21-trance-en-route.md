Hear the silence<br/>
Hear the sound<br/>
Hear the screams<br/>
Calling you out to me

Those eyes watch you from the sky<br/>
Still why doesn't anyone come to help you<br/>
You are on your one<br/>
Don't call for help

This red sky is just nothing<br/>
This is not the end<br/>
Fight your way through the darkness<br/>
I will be there waiting for you

Hold my hand<br/>
Take me by the arm<br/>
We both don't know everything<br/>
Let's put this epic down into the books

Do you dream or just make false promises to yourself?<br/>
Everywhere I see, I see nothing but disasters<br/>
I need someone to help me<br/>
Stay by my side, don't let me fall down
