For the last few days, I have been working on multiple projects and trying to *open my mind* to more and more ideas.

As of now, one of my hands is deep in this project I am doing for my college, I will be releasing the code once it is implemented. And the other project is [GradeApp][1].

## GradeApp

This is a little project I decided to work on to better my skills. I will explain about it in the following sections.

### What exactly is it?

A single-page application for calculating your CGPA.

### Whatâ€™s so cool about it?

For the user, it would be just a good interface and lightning fast speed.

For the developers, I am using [Slim][2] (a PHP micro framework) and [store.js][3].

### Why am I working on it?

The reason for working on this tiny application is to understand PHP micro frameworks as I have worked with many frameworks but never glanced at the *micro* ones. And I thought it was time to look for alternate storage types. And localStorage placed as the perfect candidate for this project.

I work on **GradeApp** in my free time so the progress is a little slow as I have two projects than need to be completed.  
Hope it comes out well.
