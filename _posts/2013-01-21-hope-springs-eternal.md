The wind never dies<br/>
These thoughts never cease<br/>
Shades of black describe everything<br/>
I see people clad in white<br/>
Is this another aimless journey called life?

Walk with me<br/>
Let me take you by your hand<br/>
Stop living with yourself<br/>
Your life is worth living<br/>
Don't let it waste by

These thoughts will scar your memory<br/>
I am not just another somebody<br/>
Do i mean anything to you?<br/>
Even if you won't say it<br/>
But i still know

In the wake of determination<br/>
I take an oath<br/>
That I'll keep you safe<br/>
No matter what storms may come<br/>
And disasters dawn<br/>
I will not let you feel alone<br/>
As long as I'm there with you
