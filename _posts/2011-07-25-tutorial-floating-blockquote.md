You would have seen this at a number of places. There is a blockquote to one side and the content is flowing around it.

Go through the post if you have no idea about how to do it.

The HTML

    <p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p>
    
                <blockquote>
                    <p>This is our blockquote floated to left with a fixed width<br/>Done using :nth-of-type property</p>
                </blockquote>
    
                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, <a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>
