<p class="lead">I have been experimenting yet again and I am writing this post for people who might be interested in knowing how I work.</p>

<div class="media" markdown="1">
![My Workspace](/assets/images/my-toolshed/workspace.jpg "My workspace")
</div>

That's how my workspace looks. I work with four workspaces, on one I run my music player, the other one runs my browser, the third has my editor and the last one has the terminal running. All this segregation has resulted due to the use of [dotfiles](https://github.com/aniketpant/dotfiles). **Yes, dotfiles.**

<div class="media" markdown="1">
![The editor](/assets/images/my-toolshed/editor.jpg "The editor")
</div>

I use [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) as my text editor and it is absolutely brilliant. Also, I recently ditched the use of Frontier as my theme and switched to _Bluedawn_.

<div class="media" markdown="1">
![Terminal](/assets/images/my-toolshed/terminal.jpg "Terminal")
</div>

The rest of it is fairly simple. My `bash` has been replaced by `zsh`, which in-turn uses [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). My theme for `zsh` is _gallois_, it's pretty sweet- less clutter, gives me more space to work and works well with plugins.

That's pretty much it. I depend on the three tools mentioned above and then I have [Clementine](http://www.clementine-player.org/) which plays music all day long.
