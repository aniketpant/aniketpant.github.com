The train passes the last stop<br/>
Watching the mountains pass by<br/>
I am just another man<br/>
Trying to die for something right

See the light at the tunnel's end<br/>
Beyond that lies a barren land<br/>
Hear the blasts, hear the fire<br/>
Don't lose faith in yourself

You know it in your heart<br/>
You know, you're right<br/>
Feel that life in yourself<br/>
Behind you, lay another fallen life

Now you have another reason to live for<br/>
Do not die on him<br/>
Or on that girl at home<br/>
Life runs on hope

Hope is what i have<br/>
I have faith in you<br/>
But you need to stay strong<br/>
And when you return, there won't be a flag over your body

I know this<br/>
And i know this for sure<br/>
Your return would be<br/>
The time the darkness died
