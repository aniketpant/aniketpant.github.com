The skyline<br/>
Blue<br/>
Lit up with lights

Sweet lime and orange<br/>
Someday lavender<br/>
You still remember the smell

The tree<br/>
Autumn it was<br/>
Leaves floating, flying around

My days<br/>
Might have lost some color<br/>
But they still aren't gray

Dim lights and dull sounds<br/>
I still hear my heart beat<br/>
From nothing to green leaves
