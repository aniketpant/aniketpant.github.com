I just need you by my side<br/>
You will always be locked inside my heart<br/>
I am incomplete without your smile<br/>
Don't cry just smile for this time<br/>
The cheer on your face makes my day<br/>
I hope i can be with you again<br/>
Just one day or maybe just for a while<br/>
I have learnt many things in all this time<br/>
Crying won't help neither you nor me<br/>
And what we have done won't help anyone<br/>
These days would come again<br/>
But not the time we spent with each other till date<br/>
Don't cry when you read this<br/>
Because I already am and I'm not fine
