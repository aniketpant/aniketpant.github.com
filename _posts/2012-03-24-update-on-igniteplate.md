My latest self project is coming off really well. In the last 2 days, I have made quite a progress.

**Codeigniter + Template = Igniteplate**

This is how the name came up and since then I never bothered to delve more into then name. I find it stupid to find reasons and change things when I have started work on them.

## The Changes

So, the latest changes in Igniteplate are —

1.  Change in design and layout.
2.  Twitter Bootstrap 2.0
3.  Prefixfree
4.  Documentation
5.  A temporary logo
6.  Font Awesome instead of the default glyphicons
7.  A trello board

### Change in design and layout

This was my first concern to deal with once I had started work on it. For the last 6 months, all my CI projects had a similar layout and it wasn’t very flexible. The current layout gives me more scope for new elements to be placed here and there.

### Twitter Bootstrap 2.0

I have upgraded the [Twitter bootstrap][1] version and made all the required changes.

### Prefixfree

No more headaches of putting vendor prefixes before my css properties. [Prefixfree][2] does it all for me.

### Documentation

I have started documenting all my work on Igniteplate and created a simple help book so far. Will continue to add more content to it.

### A temporary logo

_image missing_

This is the temporary logo for Igniteplate.

I have just colored it. That’s all I did. The two parts are from [The Noun Project][4].

I used a [fire][5] logo and a [plate][6] logo and came up with this. Even if I continue to use this, I need to make it more intricate, as I find this really stupid and simple.

### Font Awesome instead of the default glyphicons

The reason for this shift is that a font gives me more freedom for playing with the size and colors of each element.

This is what [font awesome][7] is.

### A trello board

Instead of posting more and more twitter updates on this. Checkout the Igniteplate [board][8] on Trello.

[Checkout][9] Igniteplate on github.

I am working on Social Auth at the moment. Should take me another week to get done with it and come out with a version 1.4
