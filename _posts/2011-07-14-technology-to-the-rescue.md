Neck aches are damn pissing off but they are a part and parcel of a coder’s life.

Can’t help them but can’t avoid them too. Leaving this topic aside, there is something interesting about the changing world.

A couple of years ago people kept telling me not to go into the IT industry and they still do. They would say that it won’t help. The industry won’t sustain for too long. I never listened to all of that. And yesterday, even though a tragedy took place, there was something interesting about it.

Read [this][1] article for a minute.

People were helping out each other with Twitter and even Google doc came to help. **Pretty interesting**. There was a hashtag [#heretohelp][2] and a Google doc created by Nitin Sagar, and that too from New Delhi.

Now if someone tells me that IT is all a waste… Hmmm… I don’t know what I would do, but I won’t give a damn.
