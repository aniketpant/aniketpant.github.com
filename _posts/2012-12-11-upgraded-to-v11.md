## What all changed in the past week

If you have noticed I have shifted from WordPress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The simple reason why I did this is the amount of  freedom I get. All I need to do is run a `rake` command and I have my post ready. Another rake command makes a page and then templates are too easy to manage and edit. Pushing changes is exactly the way any git lover likes them. These are just a couple of features of Jekyll and my website is being hosted by Github now (and that's quite wonderful, though my old hosting space is going real waste).

Also, I have stopped using Netbeans and shifted to [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com). ST2 is a brilliant text editor &mdash; ultra-light and super easy to work with. And the best part are the [themes coded by Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes).

Along with all of this, I have set a couple of targets for myself for the **15 days** I am getting in the semester break. I plan to religiously write a post everyday and work on a Ruby based open source project.

<span class="highlight">And I am definitely going to send an article through to [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com).</span>

## <span class="delta note">So what is so good about my new site</span>

 1. Readability
 2. Speed
 3. Design
 4. Importance to type
 5. It's _hand-coded_

P.S. [Corkscrew](http://www.agroman.net/corkscrew) is damn cool! Trust me.
