After roughly three months of unexplainable inactivity and extreme learning experience, I feel that I can start working on core modules of many applications.

## Learning over the past few months

The only way I can support the above is by stating a couple of things that I have learnt in the past few months.  
Here are some tips that you should focus on -

1.  Choose the best tool
2.  Use the capabilities of your framework
3.  Learn the language better you know best
4.  Rewrite old code and become better

## Crazy current situation

At present I have two options. One takes me back to an old project that I dumped because of lack of functionality in the framework. And the other option is to go for the same old project but instead of a the old framework, I can choose to go for a better one.

The first option will involve lots of code rewriting that I am thoroughly enjoying. But the other one will make my work simpler and will not let me face massive challenges.

But I think that I will ditch both and go for a complete new idea to work on. **And that is contributing to both the frameworks.**  
As of now I know what I can do better and it seems like going for new ideas and working on the core will help me learn better. And along with all of that I will keep fiddling and dabbling with new stuff.

All of this seems so exciting and I am most probably going to stay this way for the next few months.

## Things on my list

*   **Shift to linux once again and run AOE III from the Virtual Box. (Because it seems so cool)**
*   Learn to work with micro-frameworks - specifically [Toro][1] because it’s so cool too!
*   Write something for [A List Apart][2]
*   Work my way to another redesign that will not be so focused on development but be a mix of my personality and code
*   Do my best in organising [Mark My Word][3]

A shift from applications to the core should be good for me.
