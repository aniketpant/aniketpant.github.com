Waves 2011 got over on 5th and I have lazed around since then, not much to do. Well, actually there is lots to do, but recently everything seems lazy.

And this reminds me of The Chariot’s album name -

> Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing Nothing Is Dead and Nothing Is Bleeding.

The work on my list -

*   Finish existing projects by this month.
*   TEDx Goa site
*   Some CSS demos
*   Quark event – R.I.P. Open

Yesterday was one of my the most laziest day, this year, I did absolutely nothing (didn’t even check HN every hour). Then I thought that I would write something, but that didn’t work out either. [King][1] kept bugging me throughout the day, telling me to write something :P

Most of this post is boring, so I will put in some links that I went through yesterday, they are pretty amazing.

[Hover Effects][3]

[Dark Patterns: Deception vs. Honesty in UI Design][4]

And see this one **for sure**. [Lumibots][5]
