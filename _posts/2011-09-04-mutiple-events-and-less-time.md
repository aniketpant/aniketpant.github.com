This last week has been quite a time for me.

Had to make the **TEDxBITSGoa** teaser page. (I wonder why what I made wasnâ€™t liked by them :|)

Next, I had work on the existing project, and thanks to my Dad, I got to know the importance of correct flow of data in a website (or be it anything)

Now, we have the [Wordcamp Jabalpur, India 2011][1] coming up soon.

I need to start working on the theme soon and come up with something **simple, minimalistic and amazing**!!

Tomorrow, I plan to start with the website skeleton :)
