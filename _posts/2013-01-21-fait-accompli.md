Behind this golden gate<br/>
Winter calls out for me<br/>
Find something and keep it safe<br/>
Treasure hunters live a hard death<br/>
Sing to me<br/>
Breathe you melody into my heart<br/>
Go condemn the immortal<br/>
Travel a thousand miles<br/>
Fight many battles<br/>
Die a hundred deaths<br/>
My bullet waits at your door<br/>
I am your fall<br/>
Violence disguised in blood<br/>
I am your savior<br/>
I am your life<br/>
Sacrifice is fait accompli
