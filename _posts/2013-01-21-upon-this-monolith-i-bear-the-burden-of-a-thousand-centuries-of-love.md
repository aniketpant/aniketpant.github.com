I speak to you as if you hear<br/>
But this sullen silence doesn't fade<br/>
These constellations don't define me<br/>
But when did the sky start to care

Give solace, oh traitor<br/>
Overthrow and dictate<br/>
Read all my names and you will find yours<br/>
Find me my love and I will leave alone

Bring me the sky and I will put you up<br/>
Stars give light but I'll give you the sun<br/>
Watch over me my love<br/>
Because I'm about to fall

A sepulcher awaits my name<br/>
And when I leave this place<br/>
Then you will cry beside my grave
