We all wait eagerly for an year to get over so that we can make a few more
promises to ourselves and keep ourselves going. The last year was enjoyable to
me in every single aspect.

I am person who keeps very high expectations for themselves. I try to push
myself every single day to learn more, to do better and these are the things
that keep me going. My promise for this year is going to be the very same as my
last year:

> To push harder.

## The best of 2014

I completed my graduation in Mechanical Engineering and ended up as a [software
engineer at Zomato](/2014/06/joining-zomato).

A couple of months back I participated in a half-marathon and fared well for my
first time. Since, then I have tried to put in more effort into running and I am
pretty sure that I will clock a time under 2 hours in my next attempt.

This Christmas I participated in my first ever Secret Santa and to be frank,
this was the best experience I have ever had with gifting. Since then, I have
been telling all my friends about it and encouraging them to be a part of it.

Regarding my health, I can very well say that I am not in my best shape and I am
working towards it. After lurking on the
[/r/keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto) subreddit for a long time, I have
finally decided that I am going to give it a shot. I am about to complete a week
but so far I have not been able to keep my carbohydrates in check, though every
day turns out to be better than the last.

## Plans for 2015

There are a few projects of my own that are pending since the last year, and I
hope to complete them this year.

I have also been engaged in a long battle of
writing often since I have started working professionally and I will try my best
to do justice to it.

Thanks to my Secret Santa, I have the entire series of [A Song of Ice and
Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) that I need to start
reading.

I will also eat healthy and try to run more often.

**Let's make the most of this year and try to be better!**
