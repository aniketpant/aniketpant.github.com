Don't just breathe<br/>
Feel life<br/>
The life in my veins

Well I'm not dead<br/>
Blood flows through my veins<br/>
I'm no puppet of yours<br/>
My heart beats fast<br/>
Faster than you can speak up,<br/>
For yourself!

Untie your hands<br/>
Let your thoughts wonder<br/>
Into a dreamland<br/>
Don't let him drive you to his Doom!

Sadness is not all around me<br/>
It just find some pieces in my life<br/>
Ruins, not everything is like that<br/>
Find what you want<br/>
Take it and keep it safe<br/>
Don't let misery fall upon it!
