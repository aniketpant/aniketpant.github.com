Minimalistic Me returns with a bang and now it’s cleaner, more readable and amazingly prettier.  
I shall not make you wonder more about the name Minimalistic Me. It’s the name of my old theme.

## Origin of Name

I am not one bit aware of the exact definition of *minimalist* but I guess my previous design incorporated it pretty decently.  But the new one does the job better.  
To me minimalism means a clean background, no funky patterns, readable fonts and a fluidity. I guess the fluid part means the most as it gives it a frameless layout.

Earlier, I planned the theme name to be The Return. Then I tried out some other names too but they just didn’t fit. So, I finally settled with *The Return of Minimalistic Me.*

## The New Theme

All the themes I have made so far were quite rigid. Now, rigid here is a very big term as it has a specific meaning for me.  
If people say that WordPress does everything for me and I doesn’t take me much effort to keep making changes to my blog. For me, it’s a completely different thing.

In the present situation, WordPress doesn’t do everything for me. I need to make changes to my codes if I want to changes some elements.  
Now, people would begin to say *“what an ass he is”*. He wishes to create a set of another CMS based operation in a CMS.  
My answer to that would be a mighty YES.

I wish to make changes to a lot of my static content which comes from templates from my admin controls only. And I have started making changes to my theme to incorporate them. And for making these changes all you need to know is* how to develop theme options.*

### Features

There are many new features in my theme and I will list all of them with a brief on each.

#### Theme Options

There is a text box that I have in my theme options menu that allows me to edit the *about me info* which appears on my home page.

#### Shortcodes

There are two shortcodes that I have created.  
This a little sidenote created for display purposes only.One allows me to make 

*sidenotes* in my posts. Sidenotes are disjoint text contents that appear onto the left of my posts.  
The other makes a *view demo* button. All I need to do is send a link to it.

#### Functions

There are a number of other functions that I needed for a long time and I have finally understood how to make the best use of functions.php.  
The about me text and shortcodes are all written in this amazing file.

#### Twitter Follow

At the end of each post you will find a rectangular block with a message on it. That’s a button that links it to my twitter profile.  
I had seen this sort of thing being used at a number of website and I found it pretty cool. So I included it in my theme too.  
Its done via a tiny PHP code that picks up a random line from a defined list and displays it in the block.

## Final Say

According to my plan, I was supposed to take a week to finish off this theme. But to my surprise I did it in 3 days.  
I will keep on building more features to it.

I would greatly appreciate a response to my blog’s redesign.
