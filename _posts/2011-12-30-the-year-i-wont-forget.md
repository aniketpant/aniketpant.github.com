The *most eventful* year is coming to an end and I don’t have many words to describe it perfectly.

## The Beginning

I was introduced to web development this very year and I am really happy about whatever I have done so far. I am still not sure, if it is development or designing that I do, so I call it *web building*.

The year started off with me using **Joomla** for sometime and then I met a senior of mine when I got back to college after vacations. He got me my first project and I was supposed to make a simple website for a restaurant. My work started off the very same day. I saw a PSD to HTML conversion tutorial by [CSS-Tricks][1] and within 2 days I could do the job. Please don’t say that I am not modest, but I did learn it pretty fast.

## The Love for WordPress

After that day I have been working ever since. For sometime I was hell-bent on using Joomla and to date I wonder why I never liked WordPress in the beginning. But my love for it grew slowly and slowly and soon I was trying to make themes on it and was following the geeky world on [Hacker News][2]. [Smashing Magazine][3] was the thing I went through daily and [CSS Wizardry][4] was my target. I still refer to Soh Tanaka’s blog for some cool tricks (I miss his posts now).

## The Internship

Another semester passed in college and I planned to do an internship. I finally got one after a long search and it was in a company called as [Logicsoft International][5]. I even bought this domain during that time. So, this company works with ASP. NET and work on government projects. It was a great learning experience over there and in my free time I used to work on a small project of mine (that reminds me that I still have to release it).

## The Honor

Two months passed and I was back in college. Around this time, I had been talking to Gaurav on twitter and we both had been talking about hosting a WordCamp. We filled the application at the same time, soon we both got replies. Mine got rejected but it wasn’t a sad thing, because his got approved. I had no idea that soon he would give me a call that I could be a speaker at [WordCamp Jabalpur][6]. In a month, after making a sudden plan to go to Jabalpur (a week before my exams), I was meeting the most amazing people I have ever met and spoke on **Theme Development and Customization**. I made some great friends who help me through a lot of things. It is still hard to believe that a guy like me, without much experience got the opportunity to speak at such a place of honor.

[BarCamp][7] was on my schedule soon and I spoke on **The Power of CSS** over there and surprised some people. To add to this, Mohit sir came all the way from Delhi for the BarCamp to meet Prajyot and me.

## To the New Year

There is a lot more than just what I have written. I still have two more articles to write for this month before I leave for college.

One of my articles is going to be a redesign of a popular web app with HTML5 and the other will be on [igniteplate][8].

A new year with lots more to do!  
All I can say is that *it’s gonna be fun.*
