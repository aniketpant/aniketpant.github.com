Watch me drown<br/>
Sink into the nothingness<br/>
Everything is not lost<br/>
Hope lives forever<br/>
Never give up<br/>
Don't look back<br/>
Don't stare!

Find what's lost<br/>
All hope is not gone<br/>
Take yourself<br/>
Smoke rises up in the air<br/>
Bridges burn<br/>
Bodies collapse<br/>
Godspeed to you

The fall arrives<br/>
Cross them all<br/>
Break everything<br/>
Try Hard<br/>
Don't leave a chance<br/>
For those cowards<br/>
to WIN!

Ride across these barren lands<br/>
Fight the battle<br/>
Which has not ended since eternity<br/>
The battle in your mind<br/>
Evoking you to lie to yourself!

Don't give up now<br/>
The war is nearly won<br/>
Blood flows like a river<br/>
Just like words flow as a stream

TAKE CONTROL
