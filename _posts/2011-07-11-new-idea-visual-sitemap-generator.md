Today has been quite a nice day.

I managed to finish pending work.

Did bug fixing in Creative Foliage. Then moved to putting my 2 CSS demos on my [git][1].

Started work on a HTML theme and then I got an idea to make a **Visual Sitemap Generator** which would be CSS based.

Will get on to making it in a while. Should be fun.
