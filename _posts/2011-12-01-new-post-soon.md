My last post on [HTML5 Semantics and Good Coding Practices][1] received a great response and a total of **6.4k** hits so far!

It’s a great thing for me. So from now on I have decided to write an article of this sort every week. One good article a week. Seems good to me.

Revealing the new article:

**The Bones of HTML5**

To be frank the title of the post is misleading. A lot of people would think that I would be writing on HTML5 and it’s structure & things.  
But actually the post is going to be on how [Bones][2] (WordPress Framework) uses HTML5.

Bones is my favorite framework and my current theme is based on it! So I plan to write on how it uses HTML5.
