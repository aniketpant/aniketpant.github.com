This wait seems so long<br/>
I stand here all alone<br/>
This stay feels so dead<br/>
As the sun falls into the sea<br/>
Dreams take over me<br/>
This sleep is never ending<br/>
Nightmares are far from here<br/>
Still why doesn't anything look so clear<br/>
Ice like blue, I watch the sky<br/>
A voice calls out for me<br/>
I turn around<br/>
There i find the missing piece<br/>
The smile on your face<br/>
Completes my day and fits perfectly<br/>
This is no dream<br/>
I am in the real world<br/>
With you by my side<br/>
I watch the sun fall into the sea
