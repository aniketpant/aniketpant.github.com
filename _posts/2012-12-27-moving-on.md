<p class="lead">I have moved to Jekyll and it's a beautiful way to build static websites. There is no visual interface and it's a perfect platform for people who like to write in Markdown.</p>

## Moving away from WordPress

I had been using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) for over a year and it had been a great companion. However, it did come with many strings attached.

 * My website grew heavier with each passing month
 * I had to logon to my website to make any change
 * Everything was online
 * I needed a database
 * For each change, I had to upload my theme

## Why Jekyll is so cool?

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is **absolutely brilliant**. Because of Jekyll my coding standards have improved and my website has evolved.

First of all, I have a greater control on my website. I develop a base template for my pages and then I nest the other templates into it. It sounds a bit complex, but it gives me the freedom to make changes easily and in a fast manner.

Secondly, I can write everything in Markdown. It's quite insane because I love Markdown.

Thirdly, my website site has reduced because everything is in the form of static HTML pages.

## How did I make it happen?

With a simple WordPress plugin, I exported all my posts to Markdown and just dumped them to a `_posts` folder. In a couple of hours, my templates were ready to function and the stylesheet was ready for action.

If I have to count the total number of hours it took me to move my website from WordPress to Jekyll along with a good amount of designing, it would be not be more than <em class="highlight">10 hours</em>. And I am quite happy with the result.

### What my site uses?

 * Obviously, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
 * [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css) written by the awesome [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry)
 * The code was written on my Ubuntu machine called "Rawrrr!" (that's the reason for the name of the site too)
 * Fonts served via [Typekit](http://typekit.com)

Harry has also moved his website to Jekyll recently and he made a blog for inuit.css too.
