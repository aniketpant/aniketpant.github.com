Take my hand<br/>
Hold me tight<br/>
I will take you out of this prison

These questions are meaningless<br/>
You know the answers yourself<br/>
The key to your freedom, lies inside you

Does it take strength to stand up?<br/>
Do these thoughts eat you up?<br/>
What do you think, you have become?

Well a puppet is what, resembles you<br/>
Your master, lies to you<br/>
So, cut these strings, And<br/>
Runaway from this hell of yours<br/>

I am not your savior<br/>
I am just a man<br/>
Leading you to the path, out of this cage
