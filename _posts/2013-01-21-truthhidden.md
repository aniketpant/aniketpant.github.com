Let's Begin

Make a Start<br/>
Find What's Wrong

I am Here, there you go<br/>
Leaving me here, What's Left to do?<br/>
Come back, start something else, not wars!

[Chorus]
I have been waiting for something new<br/>
I have been waiting for someone to find me<br/>
I can't find you there<br/>
I can't see you there<br/>
Standing all alone

I can't just wait<br/>
I can't hold on (x2)


Let's just go back to where we began<br/>
Let's just go back and find where it started

[Chorus]

It's Killing Me<br/>
Crushing<br/>
things go blank<br/>
Disasters<br/>
Stay Back

(Start)
Truth marks the start of a war that never began<br/>
Leaves fall down, the wind blows

What have you been waiting for?<br/>
Just someone to explain-<br/>
Why all this pain?

PAIN<br/>
WAR<br/>
SUFFERINGS
