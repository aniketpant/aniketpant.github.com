High above the sky<br/>
Over the clouds and the moon<br/>
Pure and white as snow<br/>
Engulfed in beautiful solitude

Where i lie seeing the sun go<br/>
Into the horizon<br/>
Like a Sunday afternoon<br/>
Lost in the northern lights<br/>

None of us will know<br/>
Of how you and me came<br/>
Together for sometime

Be it your amazing grace or<br/>
Eternal beauty and glory

Holding the sword by the hilt<br/>
En route to get it done<br/>
Releasing the sands of time<br/>
Ending the pandemonium forever
