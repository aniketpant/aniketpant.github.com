Musket is the latest RubyGem I am working on. The project started off after I was fed up of writing standard files again and again. We front-end developers need to create many HTML files which have a standard structure. We also write a a lot CSS and JS, and most of these files have a similar starting point.


As of now [Musket](https://rubygems.org/gems/musket) doesn't do a lot of things other than generating a file with a standard HTML template but I do have a few things in mind for extending it. I wish to bring in templates for jQuery plugins and other HTML modules that are always required for demos and mockups. These HTML templates would include elements like tables and lists, as they are the elements I need frequently.
