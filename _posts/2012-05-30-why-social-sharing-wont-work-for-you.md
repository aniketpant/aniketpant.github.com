Social media marketing was a big hype a couple of years ago and now it is dying. Or I should say it’s dead. The fashion is gone and now’s time of bringing out what your product really is.

## The problem

Social sharing won’t work now because we have options now.  
As a consumer, I have many options now. I am specific about what I want and there is not bullshit that figures on my list.

### Case: Facebook

I will give a simple example of what I do. At the moment, my Facebook feed is divided into **multiple lists** and mostly it’s just brands & the pages I have liked there. I have unsubscribed many people, because I do not want to see *9GAG* on my feed the whole day.

If you think that you can market your product and get a following just my a simple Facebook page, then you’re wrong. I guess you haven’t been on the lookout for what all features the consumers have. I can **unsubscribe** you and most of your marketing team the moment I see boring updates from you.

**And the best part. **If you think that when your team shares your statuses, links and picture; They are not reaching many people. Most of your shares are left out in your small circle of people.

### Case: Twitter

If you think that a simple **hashtag** on Twitter will get you all popular, then I won’t be on the lookout for your tweets anymore.

A hashtag is not enough to build a following. You need to interact with your users, you need to get down to real business. Not just petty tweets with your hashtag.

### Case: Internet Memes

This is the current generation which is running wild. We have **rage comics** and **internet memes** coming out ever single minute. People post new stuff on 9GAG & similar sites and the rest of the world spends their whole day sharing them on Facebook.

I clearly remember the Facebook generations.

1.  First Generation: **Posting on walls.** This is what Facebook was meant to be.
2.  Second Generation: **Farmville.** People went mad after this gaming and we would get request everyday to *be their neighbors*.
3.  Third Generation: **The Meme.**

Right now, we are part of  **The Meme**, which surely has sucked the life out of me. I get tired of seeing them the whole day and just like me, many people ignore them. So, marketing via memes might not do well.

## How to fix this problem

1.  **Be Relevant and Timely  
    **Share relevant information. Don’t go around sharing your home page every day.
2.  **Breaking out your hashtag to the world isn’t everything  
    **There are other approached you can adopt. Tweet your followers and be on the lookout of what the consumers want.
3.  **Interact and Participate  
    **Sharing isn’t everything. You need to talk to your followers and get some discussions going around.
