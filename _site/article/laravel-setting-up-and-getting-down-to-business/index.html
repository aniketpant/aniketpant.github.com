	  	<p>After three days of tinkering with Laravel, I finally have it set up and ready to work.</p>

<p>Coming from a Codeigniter background, it did take me some time to understand how it is functioning.<br />
Let me describe my three days with <strong>Laravel</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Laravel is so cool. The documentation is superb and so many amazing features to work on. Let’s give it a shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was my first reaction when I saw the documentation and I immediately installed it.</p>

<p>For the first half an hour, I didn’t understand why I was able to see the directory listing on the opening it on my server. That shouldn’t have been the case.<br />
I had followed all the instructions given in the documentation and it should have been working.</p>

<h3 id="the-tale-of-the-splash-page">The tale of the splash page</h3>

<p>The first thing I didn’t get was that their was no index.php and yet it said that if I have mod_rewrite enabled along with the apt .htaccess file, it should show me the <strong>beautiful splash page</strong>.</p>

<p>I checked application/routes.php and thought that <em>I am so cool</em>, I can figure it out all by myself. I made a change and went ahead.</p>

<p>Sadly, no splash page came and all I got was a directory listing. Then I started opening the folders and when I opened public, I got errors.<br />
After a while, I reverted back to the original routes.php file and on refreshing, the page showed up.</p>

<p>Hurray!</p>

<p>I started reading the beautifully laid out offline documentation and understood how to register <strong>routes &amp; controllers</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Controllers</li>
  <li>Routes</li>
  <li>Validation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>

<p>Day 2 started off really well. I start creating my views and learnt how to route requests.<br />
I made two controllers in total and their required views. Used the awesome <strong>blade</strong> templating engine.</p>

<p>Feeling invincible, I moved on to create the <strong>models</strong>. But, no. I still had to try out some other things which I wanted to do from before but with Codeigniter it was difficult.</p>

<h3 id="the-amazing-artisan">The Amazing Artisan</h3>

<p>We have something called as <strong>artisan</strong> in Laravel.</p>

<p>Artisan provides us with a <strong>Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong>. Just write a simple line in English and you have database migrations set up. Run tasks and install bundles. It’s amazing.</p>

<p>I thought of setting up an administrator account and do the basic configuration by making a task. The task was easy to write. It would call up a model and use the functions. Sounds simple.</p>

<h3 id="models-wreaking-havoc">Models Wreaking Havoc</h3>

<p>I was now required to make models. From my Codeigniter experience, models are placed in application/models. Even here it’s all the same. So, I made my two files and wrote all the functions.</p>

<p>Codeigniter uses an <strong>active query</strong> method to interact with databases.<br />
Laravel provides us with two methods to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Fluent Query Builder</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Eloquent ORM</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Like an idiot I read Eloquent ORM and opened Fluent Query Builder. This was my first mistake (you will understand what implications it has soon).</p>

<p>I wrote my models with the Fluent Query Builder and tried to run the tasks using artisan. One task ran and the other failed.<br />
Made some changes but it didn’t budge. So, I left it for Day 3.</p>

<h4 id="takeaways-1">Takeaways</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Templating</li>
  <li>Artisan</li>
  <li>Database Interaction</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>

<p>I was very confident that I would nail it today.<br />
The first thing I did was to make a separate branch on the git repo and start working on a new way to do it.</p>

<p>I read about Eloquent ORM. It required me to make a model for each of my tables. My application has seven tables, so that makes it seven models.<br />
Sounds fine.</p>

<p>So, I made the tables on my database. But soon I saw what <strong>migrations</strong> could do.</p>

<h3 id="migrations">Migrations</h3>

<p>Migrations are a powerful tool in Laravel.<br />
Use artisan to create a migration and then code your table schemas in it. This will help you create tables easily and in times of distress, you can rollback the changes.</p>

<p>From the documentation, I coded my migrations and ran it. In one line of code, my tables were ready. I thought of taking them down. One command and my database was like a new-born baby.</p>

<p>Having understood migrations, now it was time to code the models.</p>

<h3 id="eloquent-orm">Eloquent ORM</h3>

<p>I started building the models and they were ready in no time. But on running the tasks, they didn’t seem to work. I couldn’t understand why.<br />
Then I remembered about the naming conventions of Laravel and the way I had named the models, it was all incorrect.</p>

<p>My models were named like this: abc_def_ghi.<br />
For these models to work, I need to make them like this: abc/def/ghi.</p>

<p>And the job was done!</p>

<h4 id="takeaways-2">Takeaways</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Migrations</li>
  <li>Eloquent ORM</li>
  <li>Invincibility</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="finale">Finale</h2>

<p>Everything was working now.<br />
Now, was the time to feel invincible and I did feel that way.</p>

<p>It was a great experience to tackle these problems. Sometimes, new methods give you a hard time but all you need to do is <strong>tame them</strong>.</p>
