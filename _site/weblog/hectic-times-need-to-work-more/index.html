	  	<p>Today I feel that I have reached my limit. And I am feeling great about it.</p>

<p>Yes! Most people might be surprised that I am happy about the fact that I am tired and weary at the moment but it surely is a good thing.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks I have been busy with some tremendous amount of work. Let me highlight some of my activities.</p>

<h2 id="mark-my-word">Mark My Word</h2>

<p><a href="http://markmyword.in" title="Mark My Word Conference">Mark My Word</a> is a conference that I am doing next year and most of my vacation went into research and contacting speakers. It was a mighty task but at the same time it was an interesting experience. The team for the conference worked on researching and contacting speakers.</p>

<p>And it the latter part we worked on the design for the website, brochures and our beautiful logo made by my good friend Saurabh Soni.</p>

<h2 id="bits-inventory-app">BITS Inventory App</h2>

<p>The second part of my routine was working on a [college project][3]. Now, this project has a lot of background story.</p>

<p>I had been working on it for over two months because I wasn’t provided with the option of rewriting the whole application. So, the whole time I kept working on fixing bugs and making small-small changes.</p>

<p>Then came the best part. I was given the option to rewrite the entire application during the vacations.</p>

<p>The work on the application was really incredible because I tried out a new PHP framework which is my favorite now. It’s called Laravel.<br />
And because of the project I was able to understand so much more about application architecture design.</p>

<h2 id="other-side-projects">Other Side Projects</h2>

<p>I even had the opportunity to work on some smaller projects for friends. One of them was the [Celestia][4] website.</p>

<p>Other than this project I did get some small projects too which were focused on WordPress feature development and not exactly the design.</p>

<h2 id="the-following-weeks">The following weeks</h2>

<p>In the next week I need to wind up one project on which I am working with my father. Then another website is pending and I also need to contact speakers and speak to a couple of sponsors for the conference.</p>

<p><strong>I like being on the edge.</strong></p>
