<p>This room is not what it seems like<br />Go see the painting on the wall<br />The future is painted in black and white<br />And if I’m not right, then you better be wrong.</p>

<p>Shed your inhibitions<br />Break these walls<br />Look outside<br />Feel the rain</p>

<p>You don’t need to search for the light<br />Come close to me my love<br />I’ll show you the life in you<br />Stay near, don’t ever leave</p>

<p>Flowers give in to spring<br />Even the leaves fall in autumn<br />But the love we have will last<br />Till the stars shine in the skies</p>

<p>I hope you won’t ever go<br />The smile would last forever<br />And your beauty won’t fade away<br />Just like this serenade will never end.</p>
