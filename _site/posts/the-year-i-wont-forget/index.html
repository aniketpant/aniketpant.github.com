  	<p>The <em>most eventful</em> year is coming to an end and I don’t have many words to describe it perfectly.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p>I was introduced to web development this very year and I am really happy about whatever I have done so far. I am still not sure, if it is development or designing that I do, so I call it <em>web building</em>.</p>

<p>The year started off with me using <strong>Joomla</strong> for sometime and then I met a senior of mine when I got back to college after vacations. He got me my first project and I was supposed to make a simple website for a restaurant. My work started off the very same day. I saw a PSD to HTML conversion tutorial by <a href="http://css-tricks.com/" title="CSS-Tricks">CSS-Tricks</a> and within 2 days I could do the job. Please don’t say that I am not modest, but I did learn it pretty fast.</p>

<h2 id="the-love-for-wordpress">The Love for WordPress</h2>

<p>After that day I have been working ever since. For sometime I was hell-bent on using Joomla and to date I wonder why I never liked WordPress in the beginning. But my love for it grew slowly and slowly and soon I was trying to make themes on it and was following the geeky world on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a>. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" title="Smashing Magazine">Smashing Magazine</a> was the thing I went through daily and <a href="http://csswizardry.com/" title="CSS Wizardry">CSS Wizardry</a> was my target. I still refer to Soh Tanaka’s blog for some cool tricks (I miss his posts now).</p>

<h2 id="the-internship">The Internship</h2>

<p>Another semester passed in college and I planned to do an internship. I finally got one after a long search and it was in a company called as <a href="http://www.lsipl.com/" title="Logicsoft International">Logicsoft International</a>. I even bought this domain during that time. So, this company works with ASP. NET and work on government projects. It was a great learning experience over there and in my free time I used to work on a small project of mine (that reminds me that I still have to release it).</p>

<h2 id="the-honor">The Honor</h2>

<p>Two months passed and I was back in college. Around this time, I had been talking to Gaurav on twitter and we both had been talking about hosting a WordCamp. We filled the application at the same time, soon we both got replies. Mine got rejected but it wasn’t a sad thing, because his got approved. I had no idea that soon he would give me a call that I could be a speaker at <a href="http://2011.jabalpur.wordcamp.org/" title="WordCamp Jabalpur 2011">WordCamp Jabalpur</a>. In a month, after making a sudden plan to go to Jabalpur (a week before my exams), I was meeting the most amazing people I have ever met and spoke on <strong>Theme Development and Customization</strong>. I made some great friends who help me through a lot of things. It is still hard to believe that a guy like me, without much experience got the opportunity to speak at such a place of honor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.barcampgoa.org/" title="BarCamp Goa 2011">BarCamp</a> was on my schedule soon and I spoke on <strong>The Power of CSS</strong> over there and surprised some people. To add to this, Mohit sir came all the way from Delhi for the BarCamp to meet Prajyot and me.</p>

<h2 id="to-the-new-year">To the New Year</h2>

<p>There is a lot more than just what I have written. I still have two more articles to write for this month before I leave for college.</p>

<p>One of my articles is going to be a redesign of a popular web app with HTML5 and the other will be on <a href="https://github.com/aniketpant/igniteplate" title="igniteplate - Template for your Codeigniter apps">igniteplate</a>.</p>

<p>A new year with lots more to do!<br />
All I can say is that <em>it’s gonna be fun.</em></p>
