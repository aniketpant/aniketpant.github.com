Hey, I am Aniket and I have been around on the web since 2010. It's not long but it been quite an [adventure](/archive) since then.

	<h2>So, what all do I do?</h2>

I love to code. I guess there is no doubt about it. And if you still are a bit skeptical, then checkout my [Github profile](https://github.com/aniketpant).

I also [love to speak](/speaking). Though I haven't done this quite frequently but you might want to call me to your conference someday.

Along with all of the above, I am also the _Curator of [Mark My Word](http://markmyword.in)_, which is India's First Content &amp; Design Conference.
