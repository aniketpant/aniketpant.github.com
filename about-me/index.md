I am Aniket Pant and welcome to my little piece of the web that I started working on in 2010 and since then I have continued to write about all that I have done in the last few years.

I love to code. I guess there is no doubt about it. And if you still are a bit skeptical, then checkout my [Github profile](https://github.com/aniketpant).

I also [love to speak](/speaking). Though I haven't done this quite frequently but you might want to call me to your conference someday.

I am also the _Curator of [Mark My Word](http://markmyword.in)_, which is India's First Content &amp; Design Conference.
