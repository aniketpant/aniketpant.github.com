Hey. I am Aniket Pant.  
A second generation coder, a speaker and a poet.

My fling with coding started when I was 13. It was enticing to me, and I loved it alot.  
I have been trying out new technologies since then. I have tried many things but loved only some.

I love to build applications using **Codeigniter** (that means I love PHP).  
Using **WordPress** to make websites like I am using a *warp drive*.  
**Writing** [articles][2] and [speaking][3] on front-end development.

I have spoken at WordCamp Jabalpur 2011 on *Theme Development and Design* and on *The Power of CSS* at BarCamp Goa 2011.

I can do the following:

I am not a designer.  
I can only write syntax for design.

*   Make hand coded **HTML(5)** and **CSS(3)** websites
*   Develop web  apps with **PHP** and **Codeigniter**
*   Build **WordPress Themes**

I also have knowledge of **ASP .NET** and have worked with **SQL Server 2005**.

### What I Want To Do

I wish to **travel** and **speak** at conferences. Yes, that’s what I wish to do!

Currently, I am working on my own CMS called [Igniteplate][4]. It’s a development based CMS based on Codeigniter to speed up application development using Codeigniter.  
As a developer, I felt that it took me a lot of time to start building each app where most of them had common modules. So, I researched for quite some time and found out the most common features required.

### Education

I did my high school and intermediate from [Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan][5] and now I am doing my under-graduation in Mechanical Engineering from [BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus][6].

### The Music I Love

I like drumming. Not really great at it but decent enough to play alternative.

I love **post-rock**, **metalcore** and **post-hardcore** music. You can see my last.fm [profile ][7]too.  
These are some of the bands I love.

[August Burns Red][8], [Underoath][9], [Anberlin][10], [Texas In July][11] and [End The Century][12].

### Where Can I Be Found

You can do the following —

Write to me through the [contact page][13].  
Shoot me a mail at **me[at]aniketpant[dot]com**  
Add me on [Google +][14] and ya, I am on [twitter][15] too.
