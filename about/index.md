    <p class="lede">Hey, I am <strong>Aniket</strong> and I have been around on the web since 2010. It's not long but it has been an <a href="/archive">adventure</a> since then. In all this time I have worked with various web frameworks, built a number of applications, written hundreds of lines of front-end code, refactored tonnes of old code and enjoyed every single bit of it.</p>
