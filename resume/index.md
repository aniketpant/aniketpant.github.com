          <p class="byline">Lead Front End Developer | Nov, 2012 &ndash; May, 2013</p>
          <p>The major concentration of my work was building websites which have a strong foundation making them easier to scale. During my term at Web Mutiny, I worked on two projects &ndash; Instamojo and Current News.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong><arel="nofollow" href="https://www.instamojo.com">Instamojo</a></strong>
              <p>Created a static website design using Jekyll. inuit.css was used as the CSS framework as it provides a strong foundation for designing. All page templates and basic page designs were created by me.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Current News</strong>
              <p>Built a new child theme for Thesis. The theme had support for a new custom post type which was further associated with taxonomies of it&apos;s own. The features needed for creating the new site required the creation of a number of custom loops. We created a Custom Loop API of our own which made the creation of pages simpler. The theme also had a number of custom hooks created by us. Metabox support for custom post types was built using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/jaredatch/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress">Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress</a>.</p>
